                     <tr><td>It's a location based platform for buying and renting books online. It is an implementation of a B-to-C model; in layman terms, user(the customer) orders a book and the nearest book store(the business) receives the order automatically, and the book is delivered. The best feature is that, the delivery time is shortened because the user gets his order from the nearest book store around him. With this idea my friend and I started Codextore, implemented and run it successfully with positive results.</td></tr>
