                     <tr><td>Its a minimal and lightweight tool for quick and easy access to MySQL databases.<br>Focused on usability and simplicity. Written in Javascript, its a single-file app and requires Node.js to run. Its very easy to setup and use.
                        <br>The goal of nodeMiniAdmin was to create a simple and lightweight app for quick-querying the SQL databases. Its ideal for developers who mainly need to <i>only</i> perform quick queries. I hope it serves as a valuable tool for the open-source community.

                     <tr><td>It's a location-based platform for buying and renting books online built on a B2C model. In simple terms, when a user places an order, the nearest bookstore automatically receives it and delivers the book. The key advantage is faster delivery, since orders are fulfilled by stores closest to the user. With this idea, my friend - <a class="links" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hitesh-tiwari-724636125/">Hitesh Tiwari</a> and I founded Codextore, implemented it, and successfully ran it with positive results.</td></tr>

                     <tr><td>(Archived) HiSchool is a cloud-based, secure, and scalable School Management Solution designed to help schools go completely paperless. Built on a custom MVC-like pattern in core PHP, it includes all the essential features a school needs. Although I've discontinued work on this project, I welcome anyone interested in taking it forward — your contributions will be greatly appreciated.</td></tr>

Based on user feedback, it has proven to be a valuable, time-saving tool for traders and stock brokers.</td></tr>

                     <tr><td>(Archived) PythonMiniAdmin is a lightweight MySQL admin application built with Python and the Django framework. Similar to MySQL Workbench, it lets you create and manage database connections with ease. The latest version adds support for exporting results to CSV, with real-time query validation planned for future updates.
                        <br>I have since discontinued work on this project and built a new application called <a class="links" onclick='fetchPage(this);' href="/projects/nodeminiadmin">nodeMiniAdmin</a>.

Simply enter a webpage URL, and it automatically fetches all available images using the HTMLAgility Pack.
